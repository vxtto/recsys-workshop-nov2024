# Recommender Systems in the Cloud Workshop - November 2024

Welcome all to this workshop. We will build a recommendation engine and deploy it on two of the most used cloud tools in this space: Snowflake and SageMaker.

## Pre-requisites

Before coming to the workshop, you **MUST** complete all the steps that follow. If you don't, you will not be able to play around with the technology when you are on site!

### What We Need

- A Linux machine
- Docker
- A Serverless account
- The aws cli installed

#### Linux Machine

Coming with a Linux machine is not mandatory, but you will have a hard time following and we cannot help debug Windows machines (or Mac).

#### Docker

Install Docker by following the steps in the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### Serverless

1. Go to [serverless.com](https://www.serverless.com) and register an account.
2. Follow their instructions to install the Serverless framework on your machine and check if it's working.

For non-commercial uses, this service is free, so don't worry about free tiers.

#### AWS cli

Install the aws cli by following the steps in the [aws documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
